Description: Provides tools for large-scale protein motif analysis and visualization in R. PMScanR facilitates the identification of motifs using external tools like PROSITE's ps_scan (handling necessary file downloads and execution) and enables downstream analysis of results. Key features include parsing scan outputs, converting formats (e.g., to GFF-like structures), generating motif occurrence matrices, and creating informative visualizations such as heatmaps, sequence logos (via seqLogo/ggseqlogo). The package also offers an optional Shiny-based graphical user interface for interactive analysis, aiming to streamline the process of exploring motif patterns across multiple protein sequences.
